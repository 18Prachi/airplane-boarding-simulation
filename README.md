# ✈️ Airplane Boarding Simulation

This project simulates the airplane boarding process using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The goal is to model and improve the boarding sequence in a way that reduces overall boarding time and congestion.

Whether you're new to RL or curious about how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems like airport logistics — this is a great place to start!

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/airplane-boarding-simulation.git
   cd airplane-boarding-simulation

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 How to Run
**To launch the simulation, run:**
   ```bash 
      python main.
