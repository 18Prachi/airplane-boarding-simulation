This project simulates the airplane boarding process using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The goal is to model and improve the boarding sequence in a way that reduces overall boarding time and congestion.

Whether you're new to RL or curious about how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems like airport logistics — this is a great place to start!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Gym / Gymnasium** – Environment interface
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – For optional visualizations (if enabled)

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/airplane-boarding-simulation.git
   cd airplane-boarding-simulation

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If you face errors with Gym or Matplotlib, you might need:
   ```bash
   pip install gymnasium matplotlib numpy
   ```

## 🚀 How to Run
**To launch the simulation, run:**
   ```bash 
      python main.py
   ```
**This will:**
   - Initialize the environment
   - Train (or load) the RL agent
   - Begin simulating boarding sequences
   
**You’ll see:**
   - Console output showing progress
   - Optional: visualization of boarding process (if graphical output is enabled)
